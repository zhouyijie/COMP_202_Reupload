The SIG Sauer SSG 2000 is a bolt-action, magazine fed rifle.
Service use[edit]
The SSG 2000 sniper rifle is a joint effort by Swiss company SIG Arms (now SAN Swiss Arms) and German company J.P.Sauer & Sohn. Production of the SSG 2000 started in 1989 and it is still in production.
Description[edit]
The SSG 2000 is derived from the Sauer 80/90 target rifle. It has a bolt action with rotating handle, but non-rotating bolt. When the handle is rotated to close the action, six lugs are driven onwards from the rear part of the bolt body to lock into the receiver. The action also features a loaded chamber indicator. The heavy barrel is hammer-forged and has a flash hider/muzzle brake unit installed. The wooden stock is adjustable. The trigger is two-stage.
The SSG 2000 has no iron sights by default and is usually fitted with Schmidt & Bender X1.5-6x42 variable power or Zeiss Diatal ZA 8x56T fixed power telescope sight.
